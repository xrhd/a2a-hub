# A2A Hub

This document describes a multi-agent application demonstrating how to orchestrate conversations between different agents to help users.

This application contains four agents:
*   **Host Agent**: The primary agent that orchestrates the scheduling task.
*   **Math Agent**: An agent responsible for performing mathematical calculations or resolving scheduling conflicts that require arithmetic or logic.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

Before running the application locally, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **uv:** The Python package management tool used in this project. Follow the installation guide: [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. **python 3.13** Python 3.13 is required to run a2a-sdk 
3. **set up .env** 

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `a2a_friend_scheduling` directory with your Google API Key:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" 
```

## Run the Agents

You will need to run each agent in a separate terminal window. The first time you run these commands, `uv` will create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies before starting the agent.

### Terminal 1: Run Math Agent
```bash
cd math_agent_adk
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run .
```

### Terminal 1.1: Run Web Search Agent (Optional)
```bash
cd web_search_adk
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run .
```

### Terminal 2: Run Host Agent
```bash
cd host_agent_adk
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run adk web      
```

## Interact with the Host Agent

Once all agents are running, the host agent will begin the scheduling process. You can view the interaction in the terminal output of the `host_agent`.
